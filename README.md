# Readalyzer-AI
Readalyzer is a local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application that allows you to "talk" to your documents. It uses FastAPI for a robust backend, Streamlit for a sleek user interface, and Ollama to run the Mistral LLM entirely on your local machine ensuring your data stays private.
